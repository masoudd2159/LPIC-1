# 101.2. Boot the system

weight: 3

Candidates should be able to guide the system through the booting process.

## Key Knowledge Areas <a id="key-knowledge-areas"></a>

* Provide common commands to the boot loader and options to the kernel at boot time.
* Demonstrate knowledge of the boot sequence from BIOS to boot completion.
* Check boot events in the log files.

## Terms <a id="terms"></a>

* BIOS
* bootloader
* kernel
* init
* /var/log/messages
* dmesg

### BIOS <a id="bios"></a>

BIOS is Basic Input Output System and does the first steps of the PC bootup. For example is does a POST \(Power On Self Test\) and decides which hardware should boot the system.

### bootloader <a id="bootloader"></a>

Bootloader can be GRUB \(1&2\) or LILO which are great for disks less than 2TB.

```text
/etc/lilo.conf
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
/boot/grub/menu.lst
```

### Kernel <a id="kernel"></a>

Kernel parameters \(sometimes called boot parameters\) supply the kernel with information about hardware parameters that it might not determine on its own - say single user mod boot \(S\)

### init <a id="init"></a>

When the kernel finishes loading, it usually starts /sbin/init. This program remains running until the system is shut down. It is always assigned process ID 1.

first process, process in charge, a big family tree of commands:

```text
pstree
```

init is being replaced in many distros \(say ubuntu with upstart\) but still is in exam and has its own section.

### dmesg <a id="dmesg"></a>

**Funny fact:** During the bootup, only The Kernel is running so it should record and keep its own logs!

dmesg command will show the full data from **kernel ring buffer** up to now. But

```text
cat /var/log/dmesg
```

will show **only** the data during the boot

### /var/log/messages <a id="varlogmessages"></a>

After the init process comes up, syslog daemon will log messages. It has timestamps and will persist during restarts.

* Kernel is still logging its own messages in dmesg
* in some systems it might be called /var/log/syslog
* there are many other logs at /var/log
