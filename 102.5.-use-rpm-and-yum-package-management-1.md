# 102.5. Use RPM and YUM package management

_Weight: 3_

Candidates should be able to perform package management using RPM and YUM tools.

## Goals <a id="goals"></a>

* Install, re-install, upgrade and remove packages using RPM and YUM.
* Obtain information on RPM packages such as version, status, dependencies, integrity and signatures.
* Determine what files a package provides, as well as find which package a specific file comes from.
* rpm
* rpm2cpio
* /etc/yum.conf
* /etc/yum.repos.d/
* yum
* yumdownloader

### Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

**RedHat Package Manager \(RPM\)** and **Yellowdog Updater Modified \(YUM\)** are fedora / redhat / rhel / centos / .. tools to manage packages. There are also gui tools for installing and updating. As you saw on 102.4, all package managers can do standard functions like installing, updating and removing packages.

YUM adds extra features likes automatic updates, dependency management and works with repositories \(collection on packages accessed over network or on a CD\).

### Installing <a id="installing"></a>

Say you want to install "bzr" and you don't have it:

```text
bzr:[jadi@localhost ~]$ bzr
bash: bzr: command not found
[jadi@localhost ~]$ which bzr
/usr/bin/which: no bzr in (/usr/libexec/lightdm:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/jadi/.local/bin:/home/jadi/bin)
[jadi@localhost ~]$ whatis bzr
bzr: nothing appropriate.
[jadi@localhost ~]$ whereis bzr
bzr:[jadi@localhost ~]$
```

we can obtain the bzr RPM package and try to install it:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -i bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64.rpm 
error: Failed dependencies:
    python-paramiko is needed by bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64
```

Failed because of dependencies. RPM understands the dependencies but does not installs it itself. We need YUM:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# yum install bzr

```

> it is possible to use -y switch to prevent yum from asking _Is this ok \[y/d/N\]_

but where does YUM find these dependencies to install? it starts from /etc/yum.repos.d/

```text
$ cat /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo

```

### Removing <a id="removing"></a>

For removing a package we have to use -e option of rpm \(e for erase\) or use the _remove_ option of yum.

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -e bzr
[root@localhost ~]# bzr
bash: bzr: command not found
```

notes:

* rpm does not have a database of automatic package installation so it can not remove dependencies which are installed automatically.
* rpm removes package without asking!
* rpm wont remove a package which is needed by another package

but if you remove with yum, it will tell what other packages should be removed because of dependencies:

```text
# yum install bzr
# rpm -e python-crypto
error: Failed dependencies:
    python-crypto >= 2.1 is needed by (installed) python-paramiko-1.15.1-1.fc20.noarch
```

### Upgrading <a id="upgrading"></a>

the most common command is `yum update`. This will update the repository data and then will ask user to confirm and then will upgrade the system. It is also possible to give a single package name or use a wildcard \(\*\) to upgrade specific packages.

```text
# yum upgrade 'cal*'
```

will upgrade all packages starting with cal \(sal calendarj, calibre, ...\).

if using RPM, you can upgrade a system using -U or -F instead of -i. This is the difference:

> -i is for install, -U is upgrade or install, -F is upgrade if installed. Note that -F wont install / upgrade the package if it is not already installed.
>
> please note that in many cases, we also us -v \(verbose = print a lot of info\) and -h \(show a progress bar with hash signs \(\#\) \).

Last thing you should now is if installing or updating using `rpm` and you have many files which are dependent to each other, you can copy all your rpm files into one directory and do a `rpm -Uvh *.rpm` and rpm will install/upgrade all the packages based on their dependencies to each other.

### Querying info <a id="querying-info"></a>

You saw that rpm needed a full file name and yum needed only the package name. How can we find these info?

```text
[root@localhost ~]# yum list bzr

[root@localhost ~]# rpm -q bzr

```

It is also possible to search for packages:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# yum search hack 
Loaded plugins: langpacks
=================================================== N/S matched: hack ===================================================
nethack-vultures.x86_64 : NetHack - Vulture's Eye and Vulture's Claw
python-hacking.noarch : OpenStack Hacking Guideline Enforcement
...
...
wmMatrix.x86_64 : DockApp version of Jamie Zawinski's xmatrix screensaver hack

  Name and summary matches only, use "search all" for everything.
```

it is also possible to find **all installed** packages with `rpm -qa` \(query all\). In most cases we pipe this with `sort` or `grep` and ```less``:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -qa | grep vim 
vim-minimal-7.4.027-2.fc20.x86_64
```

If you need to find files in a installed package:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -ql bzr | head
/etc/bash_completion.d
/etc/bash_completion.d/bzr
/usr/bin/bzr
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzr-2.6.0-py2.7.egg-info
/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzrlib
...
...
```

> It is easy, query list.
>
> if you need same info for a downloaded package, just add the -p switch to your rpm command.

Another important task is checking which package, own a specific file. Lets see what package gave us the `cal` command:

```text
[jadi@localhost ~]$ which cal 
/usr/bin/cal
[jadi@localhost ~]$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/cal 
util-linux-2.24-2.fc20.x86_64
```

#### Dependencies <a id="dependencies"></a>

if you need to check what a packages is dependent on, use the `--requires` or `-R` switch:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -qR bzr
/usr/bin/python
libc.so.6()(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.14)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit)
libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3.4)(64bit)
...
...
```

or use `yum deplist bzr` instead.

Poof.. I know this part was long so here comes the last important RPM querying command: **whatprovides**.

If you need to use bzr, you need to check what provides it! if installed you can go with `rpm -q --whatprovides bzr` and if not :

```text
yum whatprovides bzr
Loaded plugins: langpacks
bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64 : Friendly distributed version control system
Repo        : fedora
```

### File Integrity <a id="file-integrity"></a>

Security is important! So RPM can check the MD5 or SHA1 of files. The option is --checksig \(-K\) and it is a good idea to use it with -v option \(verbose\):

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -vK bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64.rpm
bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64.rpm:
    Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID 246110c1: OK
    Header SHA1 digest: OK (171c91fbd14416ac44c0f6d396826d583c3840ce)
    V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID 246110c1: OK
    MD5 digest: OK (c4478d64f009d07cb17d018b377677ab)
```

The above output shows that this file is a valid file.

it is also possible to check if the installed FILES by a packages is OK:

```text
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -V bzr 
[root@localhost ~]# rm /etc/bash_completion.d/bzr 
rm: remove regular file ‘/etc/bash_completion.d/bzr’? y
[root@localhost ~]# rpm -V bzr 
missing     /etc/bash_completion.d/bzr
```

if anything goes wrong, we can always reinstall a package:

```text
yum reinstall bzr
```

### yumdownloader <a id="yumdownloader"></a>

this tool will download rpms from repositories but wont install them. If you need to download all the dependencies too, use the --resolve switch:

```text
yumdownloader --resolve bzr
```

### rpm2cpio <a id="rpm2cpio"></a>

The **cpio** is kind of an archive, just like zip or rar or tar. the rpm2cpio can convert rpm files to cpio archives so you can _open_ them using cpio command.

```text
# rpm2cpio bzr-2.6.0-2.fc20.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idv 
./etc/bash_completion.d
./etc/bash_completion.d/bzr
./usr/bin/bzr
./usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzr-2.6.0-py2.7.egg-info
./usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzrlib
./usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzrlib/__init__.py
./usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzrlib/_annotator_py.py
./usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/bzrlib/_annotator_pyx.so
...
...
```

### Other tools <a id="other-tools"></a>

YUM and RPM are the main package manager tools on Fedora, RHEL & Centos. but other system are available. The SUSE uses YaST and many modern desktops \(KDE & Gnome\) use PackageKit. Package Kit installs and updates packages on graphical interfaces on most linux systems \(Debian, Fedora, Arch, ...\).
