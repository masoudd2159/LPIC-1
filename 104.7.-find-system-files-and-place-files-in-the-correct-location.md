## 104.7 Find system files and place files in the correct location <a id="1047-find-system-files-and-place-files-in-the-correct-location"></a>

_Weight: 2_

Candidates should be thoroughly familiar with the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard \(FHS\)**, including typical file locations and directory classifications.

### Objectives <a id="objectives"></a>

* Understand the correct locations of files under the FHS.
* Find files and commands on a Linux system.
* Know the location and purpose of important file and directories as defined in the FHS.
* find
* locate
* updatedb
* whereis
* which
* type
* /etc/updatedb.conf

### FHS <a id="fhs"></a>

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard \(FHS\) is a document describing the Linux / Unix file hierarchy. It is very useful to know these because it lets you easily find what you are looking for:

| directory | usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| bin | Essential command binaries |
| boot | Static files of the boot loader |
| dev | Device files |
| etc | Host-specific system configuration |
| lib | Essential shared libraries and kernel modules |
| media | Mount point for removable media |
| mnt | Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily |
| opt | Add-on application software packages |
| sbin | Essential system binaries |
| srv | Data for services provided by this system |
| tmp | Temporary files |
| usr | Secondary hierarchy |
| var | Variable data |
| home | User home directories \(optional\) |
| lib | Alternate format essential shared libraries \(optional\) |
| root | Home directory for the root user \(optional\) |

The `/usr` filesystem is the second major section of the filesystem, containing shareable, read-only data. It can be shared between systems, although present practice does not often do this.

The `/var` filesystem contains variable data files, including spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files. Some portions of /var are not shareable between different systems, but others, such as /var/mail, /var/cache/man, /var/cache/fonts, and /var/spool/news, may be shared.

### Path <a id="path"></a>

A general linux install has a lot of files; 741341 files in my case. So how it find out where to look when you type a command? This is done by a variable called PATH:

```text
$ echo $PATH
/home/jadi/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games;/home/jadi/bin/
```

And for root user:

```text
# echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

As you can see, this is the list of directories separated with a colon. Obviously you can change your path with `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/new/dir` or put this in `.bashrc` to make it permanent.

### which, type and whereis <a id="which-type-and-whereis"></a>

The `which` command shows the first appearance of the command given in path:

```text
$ which mkfd
$ which mkfs
/sbin/mkfs
```

> use the `-a` switch to show all appearance in the path and not only the first one.

But what happens if you `which for` ?

```text
$ which for
$ type for
for is a shell keyword
```

As you can see, `which` did not found anything for `for` and we used `type`.

```text
$ type type
type is a shell builtin
$ type for
for is a shell keyword
$ type mkfs
mkfs is /sbin/mkfs
$ type mkfd
bash: type: mkfd: not found
```

The `type` command is more general that `which` and also understand and shows the _bash keywords_.

Another useful command in this category is `whereis`. Unlike `which`, `whereis` shows man pages and source codes of programs alongside their binary location.

```text
$ whereis mkfs
mkfs: /sbin/mkfs.bfs /sbin/mkfs.ext3 /sbin/mkfs.ext4 /sbin/mkfs.vfat /sbin/mkfs.cramfs /sbin/mkfs.minix /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /sbin/mkfs.msdos /sbin/mkfs.fat /sbin/mkfs.ntfs /sbin/mkfs.ext4dev /sbin/mkfs /usr/share/man/man8/mkfs.8.gz
$ whereis ping
ping: /bin/ping /usr/share/man/man8/ping.8.gz
$ whereis chert
chert:
$
```

### find <a id="find"></a>

We have already seen this command in detail but lets see a couple of new switches.

* The `-user` and `-group` specifies a specific user & group
* The `-maxdepth` tells the find how deep it should go into the directories.

```text
$ find /tmp/ -maxdepth 1 -user jadi | head
$ find /tmp/ -maxdepth 1 -user jadi | head
/tmp/asheghloo.png
/tmp/tmpAN6Drb
/tmp/wrapper-24115-2-out
/tmp/sni-qt_goldendict_20048-sRlmvN
/tmp/asheghloo.gif
/tmp/zim-jadi
/tmp/3la.txt
/tmp/unity_support_test.0
/tmp/batman.jpg
```

Or even find the files not belonging to any user / group with `-nouser` and `-nogroup`.

> Like other _tests_, you can add a `!` just before any phrase to negate it. So this will find files **not belonging** to jadi: `find . ! -user jadi`

### locate & updatedb <a id="locate--updatedb"></a>

You tries `find` and know that it is slowwwww... It searches the file system on each run but lets see the fastest command:

```text
$ locate happy
/home/jadi/.Spark/xtra/emoticons/Default.adiumemoticonset/happy.png
/home/jadi/.Spark/xtra/emoticons/sparkEmoticonSet/happy.png
/home/jadi/Downloads/jadi-net_radio-geek_040_antihappy.mp3
/usr/share/emoticons/kde4/unhappy.png
/usr/share/pixmaps/fvwm/mini.happy.xpm
/usr/share/pixmaps/pidgin/emotes/default/happy.png
/usr/share/pixmaps/pidgin/emotes/small/happy.png
/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-40-generic/include/config/happymeal.h
/usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-25-generic/include/config/happymeal.h
/usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-28-generic/include/config/happymeal.h
/usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-29-generic/include/config/happymeal.h
```

And it is fast:

```text
$ time locate kernel | wc -l 
11235

real    0m0.341s
user    0m0.322s
sys    0m0.015s
```

This is fast because its data comes from a database created with `updatedb` command which is usually run on a daily basis with a cron job. Its configuration file is `/etc/updatedb.conf` or `/etc/sysconfig/locate`:

```text
$ cat /etc/updatedb.conf 
PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS="yes"
# PRUNENAMES=".git .bzr .hg .svn"
PRUNEPATHS="/tmp /var/spool /media /home/.ecryptfs"
PRUNEFS="NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ecryptfs fusesmb devtmpfs"
```

Please note that you can update the db by running `updatedb` as root and get some info about it by `-S` switch of `locate` command:

```text
$ locate -S
Database /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db:
    73,602 directories
    711,894 files
    46,160,154 bytes in file names
    18,912,999 bytes used to store database
```
