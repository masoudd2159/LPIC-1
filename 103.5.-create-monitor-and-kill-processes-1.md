## foreground and background jobs <a id="foreground-and-background-jobs"></a>

One of the great points of linux on its beginning days, was the ability to run many programs at the same time. This is done with sending programs to the background.

Normally if you run a program on the terminal, it _blocks_ your terminal but sending a command to the background will prevent this:

```text
xeyes &
```

But what if we started it normally? We can break / cancel it with `Ctrl+c` or _suspend_ it using `Ctrl+z`.

```text
$ xeyes 
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes
$ jobs
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes
$ bg
[1]+ xeyes &
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 xeyes &
$ sleep 1000 & 
[2] 7395
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
$ fg %2
sleep 1000
^Z
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000
$ bg sle
[2]+ sleep 1000 &
$ jobs
[1]-  Running                 xeyes &
[2]+  Running                 sleep 1000 &
`
```

> -l switch of `jobs` will also show the process ID

## nohup <a id="nohup"></a>

The `nohup` command lets you run your commands even after you logged out and writes its output to **nohup.out**:

```text
$ nohup ping 4.2.2.4
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’
^C$ cat nohup.out 
PING 4.2.2.4 (4.2.2.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=225 ms
64 bytes from 4.2.2.4: icmp_seq=3 ttl=51 time=223 ms

--- 4.2.2.4 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 2 received, 50% packet loss, time 3010ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 223.584/224.767/225.950/1.183 ms
```

> It is common to use 2&gt; to redirect the nohup errors to a file: `nohup script.sh > mynohup.out 2>&1 &`

## kill <a id="kill"></a>

You can control processes by **signals**. Actually pressing `Ctrl+c` and `Ctrl+z` is also sending signals. Another way for this is using the kill command:

```text
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[4]   Running                 sleep 1000 &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ kill %4
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[4]   Terminated              sleep 1000
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
```

If is also possible to use PIDs in from of the kill or send other signals:

| signal number | signal name | meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | SIGHUP | Informing the process that its controlling terminal \(like an ssh connection\) is terminated |
| 15 | SIGTERM | normal termination request |
| 9 | SIGKILL | forcefully kills the proccess |

So you can do a `kill -9 8733` to force process ID 8733 to close.

> Now you can understand what `nohup` means: go not answer to the SIGHUP.

## killall <a id="killall"></a>

Will send the given signal \(or 15\) to all the processes with the given name:

```text
$ jobs
[3]   Running                 xeyes &
[5]-  Running                 sleep 2000 &
[6]+  Running                 sleep 3000 &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7864  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 2000
jadi      7865  7651  0 21:07 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 3000
jadi      7977  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
$ killall sleep 
[5]-  Terminated              sleep 2000
[6]+  Terminated              sleep 3000
$ jobs
[3]+  Running                 xeyes &
$ ps -ef | grep sleep
jadi      7980  7651  0 21:14 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sleep
```

## Monitoring Processes <a id="monitoring-processes"></a>

### ps <a id="ps"></a>

The `ps` command shows running processes on your computer.

```text
$ sleep 1000 & 
[1] 7678
$ sleep 1001 & 
[2] 7679
$ xeyes & 
[3] 7680
$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 7651 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
 7678 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep
 7679 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep
 7680 pts/1    00:00:00 xeyes
 7681 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```

But using `ps aux` \(= `-aux`\) or `ps -ef` is also common & shows ALL processes on this system:

```text
$ ps -aux | wc -l
293
```

> Every process has a ProcessID \(PID\) and a PPID \(Parent Process ID\).

#### finding processes <a id="finding-processes"></a>

You've seen that `ps -ef` shows processes from all users. We can `grep` on that and see who is running `gedit` and what is its process ID:

```text
$ ps -ef | grep gedit
jadi      6213  4604  9 20:06 ?        00:04:43 gedit
jadi      7725  7651  0 20:55 pts/1    00:00:00 grep gedit
```

but there is also a more direct way:

```text
$ ps -C gedit -o user,pid,tty,time,comm
USER       PID TT           TIME COMMAND
jadi      6213 ?        00:04:49 gedit
```

It is also possible to use the `--sort` switch to sort output based on different fields \(+ for ascending & - for descending\).

```text
$ ps -af --sort +comm,-sid
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root      5486  5478  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 -su
root      4444  1169  0 19:56 tty4     00:00:00 -bash
jadi      6638  5412  0 20:10 pts/0    00:00:04 node /usr/local/bin/sslocal
jadi      7778  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 ps -af --sort +comm,-sid
jadi      7678  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7679  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1001
jadi      7775  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7776  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
jadi      7777  7651  0 20:58 pts/1    00:00:00 sleep 1000
root      5478  5477  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 su -
root      5477  5008  0 19:59 pts/12   00:00:00 sudo su -
jadi      7680  7651  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:01 xeyes
```

### top <a id="top"></a>

Processes are changing and sometimes you need to check them live. `top` command will help you:

```text

```

You can see the processes, system load, uptime, CPU status, memory, ... and do some stuff:

| key during top | functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| h | help |
| q | quit |
| M | sort based on memory usage" |
| c | show full commands |
| k | kill after asking pid and signal |

## free <a id="free"></a>

The `free` command will show you info about the system memory. The default is _kilobytes_ but you can change it with `-m` for megabytes, `-g` for _gigabytes_ or even `-b` for bytes:

```text
$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          7871       5231       2640        332        169       2195
-/+ buffers/cache:       2866       5005
Swap:         7627          0       7627
```

> The system should not use swap in long term

## uptime <a id="uptime"></a>

The `uptime` command shows the time, how long the system is up, how may users are logged in and the load average of 1, 5 & 15 minutes:

```text
$ uptime
 21:18:52 up  1:34,  5 users,  load average: 2.38, 2.64, 2.41
```
