Some people have physical complications. Some can not see well, some can not see at all and some can not user their finger as I can do. Linux have 3 answers:

1- AccessX helps people with physical problems to use keyboard/mouse 2- Visual Settings help people with vision problems by magnifying the screen and things like that 3- Assistive Technologies are things like text-to-speech \(tts\) and reads the screen for people with visual problem

These options are available in display managers \(login screen\) and in major desktops \(like gnome, kde, xfce, ...\). Its logo is a human stretching its hands a legs.

In Gnome the config is located at Settings ~ Universal Access. The configurations are categorized and are as follows:

* High Contrast
* Zoom

* Slow Keys \(do not repeat keys after pressing a key for few seconds\)
* Bounce Keys \(if you hit a key twice fast, it won't accept the second one\)
* Mouse Keys \(Arrow keys on number path will work as a mouse\)
