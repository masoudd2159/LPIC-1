# Introduction

This book is originally released as a part of a series of free video tutorials for LPIC1. But it is also possible to use it as a reference for self-study to prepare for LPIC1-101 & LPIC-102 exam.

If you want to download Farsi LPIC 101 & LPIC 102 exam videos [use this torrent magnet link](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e003aba9b19bee27dab9085f79afb4ed88d856b2&dn=Jadi-net-LPIC1-Exam101and102-version1.0-July2016&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fdenis.stalker.h3q.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.tracker.thepiratebay.org%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fdenis.stalker.h3q.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sumotracker.com%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.torrent-downloads.to%3a2710%2fannounce)

I've tried to write a short, easy to understand but still comprehensive exam guide. I'm not a native English speaker be ready for some possible language flaws.

Enjoy!
