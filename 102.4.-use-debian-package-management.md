# 102.4. Use Debian package management

_weight: 3_

Candidates should be able to perform package management using the Debian package tools.

* Install, upgrade and uninstall Debian binary packages.
* Find packages containing specific files or libraries which may or may not be installed.
* Obtain package information like version, content, dependencies, package integrity and installation status \(whether or not the package is installed\).
* /etc/apt/sources.list
* dpkg
* dpkg-reconfigure
* apt-get
* apt-cache
* aptitude

## Concept of the package management system <a id="concept-of-the-package-management-system"></a>

Linux used to be based on compiling source code but then Distributions arrived. Most distributions have their own Package Manager for installing pre-build programs from defined _repositories_. Debian based distros use .deb files with apt, dpkg, aptitude and Fedora, RedHat, RHEL, SUSE, .. use RPM and Yum package managers.

## Installing packages <a id="installing-packages"></a>

We do not have "bzr" installed.

```text
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic/101$ bzr
The program 'bzr' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install bzr
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic/101$ which bzr
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic/101$ type bzr
bash: type: bzr: not found
```

so lets install it. If we have the .deb file:

```text
 apt-get install bzr
```

note that

* apt-get install asked for confirmation \(Y\)
* apt-get resolved _dependencies_, it know what is needed to install this package and installs them
* debian packages are something.deb

   bzr

if you only want a dry-run / simulation:

```text
apt-get install -s bzr
```

and this will only download the files without installing them:

```text
apt-get install --download-only bzr
```

which only ownloaded files are stored them at /var/cache/apt/archive/ \(or use the -d switch instead\)

## Package location <a id="package-location"></a>

where these packages come from? from a **Repository** of different **Repositories** which are defined at /etc/apt/sources.list file and files located at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ in the form of:

```text
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic-updates multiverse

## N.B. software from this repository may not have been tested as
## extensively as that contained in the main release, although it includes
## newer versions of some applications which may provide useful features.
## Also, please note that software in backports WILL NOT receive any review
## or updates from the Ubuntu security team.
deb http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ utopic-backports main restricted universe multiverse

deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic-security main restricted
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic-security universe
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic-security multiverse
```

Updating sources information:

```text
apt-get update
```

## Removing debian packages <a id="removing-debian-packages"></a>

```text
apt-get remove bzr
```

and if you want to remove automatically installed dependencies:

```text
$ apt-get autoremove bzr
```

or even

```text
$ apt-get autoremove
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  linux-image-3.16.0-25-generic linux-image-extra-3.16.0-25-generic
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 2 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
After this operation, 203 MB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
```

Notes:

* removing a package will not remove its dependencies
* if removing a dependency, you'll get a warning about what will be removed alongside this package

## searching for packages <a id="searching-for-packages"></a>

```text
$ apt-cache search "tiny window"
$ aptitude search grub2
```

## Updating <a id="updating"></a>

for updating a single package

```text
apt-get install tzdata
```

and for upgrading whatever installed:

```text
apt-get upgrade
```

or going to a new distribution:

```text
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

Note: as most other tools, you can configure the default configs at /etc/apt/apt.conf and there is a program apt-config for this purpose.

## reconfiguring packages <a id="reconfiguring-packages"></a>

A program called debconf configures packages after they are installed. you can reconfigure a package \(say tzdata\) using

```text
 dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

## package information with dpkg <a id="package-information-with-dpkg"></a>

dpkg is a very powerful tool for working with .deb package files. If you want to see what is inside a .deb file:

```text
$ dpkg --contents bzr_2.6.0+bzr6595-1ubuntu1_all.deb 
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2014-05-02 18:16 ./
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2014-05-02 18:15 ./etc/
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2014-05-02 18:15 ./etc/bash_completion.d/
-rw-r--r-- root/root      1467 2010-04-22 11:31 ./etc/bash_completion.d/bzr
...
...
```

another apt tool is dpkg. dpkg can install, remove, configure and query packages and as always the config is at /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg and uses /var/lib/dpkg tree . the most important switch is **-s** for **status**.

```text
$ dpkg -s bzr

Description: easy to use distributed version control system
 Bazaar is a distributed version control system designed to be easy to
 use and intuitive, able to adapt to many workflows, reliable, and
 easily extendable.
 .
 Publishing of branches can be done over plain HTTP, that is, no special
 software is needed on the server to host Bazaar branches. Branches can
 be pushed to the server via sftp (which most SSH installations come
 with), FTP, or over a custom and faster protocol if bzr is installed in
 the remote end.
 .
 Merging in Bazaar is easy, as the implementation is able to avoid many
 spurious conflicts, deals well with repeated merges between branches,
 and is able to handle modifications to renamed files correctly.
 .
 Bazaar is written in Python, and has a flexible plugin interface which
 can be used to extend its functionality. Many plugins exist, providing
 useful commands (bzrtools), graphical interfaces (qbzr), or native
 interaction with Subversion branches (bzr-svn).
 .
 Install python-paramiko if you are going to push branches to remote
 hosts with sftp, and python-pycurl if you'd like for SSL certificates
 always to be verified.

another command is **purge** which will remove the package and all of its configurations.. the switch is **-P** or **--purge**.

There is also **-L** to check the files and directories a package installed:

```text
$ dpkg -L jcal 
/.
/usr
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/jcal
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/jcal
/usr/share/doc/jcal/README
/usr/share/doc/jcal/copyright
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man1
/usr/share/man/man1/jcal.1.gz
/usr/share/doc/jcal/changelog.Debian.gz
```

and **-S** will show which package installed the given file:

```text
$ dpkg -S /var/lib/mplayer/prefs/mirrors 
mplayer: /var/lib/mplayer/prefs/mirrors
```

Note: you can also use `which` for finding out what file will be used on any given command:

```text
jadi@funlife:~/w/lpic/101$ which java
/usr/bin/java
```

## aptitude <a id="aptitude"></a>

is a newer tool for managing files. It can be used like this:

```text
$ aptitude install jcal
$ aptitude remove jcal
$ aptitude search cal 
$ aptitude show bzr
```

or it can also be used as a standalone program:

![aptitude sample](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lpic1-v3-102-4/fig-102-4-2.gif)

there is gui tools like "synaptic" and "update manager". These will Search, Update, Upgrade, Install, Remove via a graphical user interface and are present in many distributions. This is ubuntu software center:

and this is a software updater GUI for gnome:
