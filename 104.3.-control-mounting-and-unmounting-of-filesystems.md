# 104.3. Control mounting and unmounting of filesystems

weight: 3

[**http://j.mp/jadilpic1**](http://j.mp/jadilpic1)

Configure the mounting of a filesystem. Tasks include manually mounting and unmounting filesystems, configuring filesystem mounting on bootup, and configuring user-mountable removable filesystems.

* Mount and unmount filesystems manually
* Configure filesystem mounting on bootup
* Configure user-mountable, removable filesystems

## Mounting and Unmounting <a id="mounting-and-unmounting"></a>

* Describe the linux filesystem concept. A huge tree.
* There are other kinds of mountings: tmpfs, NFS, ..
* It is better to mount on empty directories

### Basic commands <a id="basic-commands"></a>

```text
cat /etc/fstab
mount /dev/sda1 /media
umount /media
```

### Some switches <a id="some-switches"></a>

```text
mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /media
mount -o remount,ro /dev/sda1
```

### Get info on UUID and Label and Format <a id="get-info-on-uuid-and-label-and-format"></a>

```text
blkid /dev/sda2
```

## Bootup <a id="bootup"></a>

/etc/fstab

* file system: Label, UUID, device
* mount point: swap or none for swap
* type: can be auto
* options: defaults, rw / ro, noauto, user, exec / noexec, noatime
* dump: do dump command backup this? mostly 0
* pass: Non-zero values of pass specify the order of checking filesystems at boot time \(seen in Integrity of file systems\)

**note:**

* User-mounted filesystems default to noexec unless exec is specified after user.
* noatime will disable recording of access times. Not using access times may improve performance.

## swap <a id="swap"></a>

```text
swapon
swapoff
swapon -s
```
